To anyone looking to enhance their in class experience and keep students engaged, we have the answer for you! We as team of CS Students understand that it can sometimes be hard for the professor to get their students attention and focus on the lecture material. This is where *Jeopardy Champ!* comes into play! With this tool you will be able to put students head-to-head by solving problems over what was just lectured and/or to ensure they are paying attention all while having fun. The game consists of multiple categories of unknown questions with low and high point value than can be selected by the team of participants in play. We aim to have a variety of features that will be visually appealing and satisfying to our users.

Currently, the project can currently be run/built. However, the current project is unstable and has not been modified to meet the project's goal. Enhancements are still underway.
